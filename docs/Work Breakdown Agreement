For assignment 1 we were both responsible to produce the UML class diagram, for the Interaction diagrams the task
was split evenly between the both of us where Gue Jia Xuan had done the interaction diagrams for breeding and allosaurs,
while Yohen Sheraun had done the interaction diagrams for grass, hungry dinosaurs and eco points and purchasing. The design rationale
was once again done by the both members of the team.

The assignment will be completed on the 27th september 2020 before 12.00 am


Yohen Sheraun : I accept the WBA
Gue Jia Xuan : I accept the WBA

For Assignment 2, Yohen dropped out of FIT 2099 so I(Gue Jia Xuan) tried my best to do what constitutes is half of the
assignment. I managed to code everything that was under "Grass" and "Hungry Dinosaurs", as well as the Allosaurs hunger
with the different actions and behaviours it can perform towards Stegosaurs and players.
The Class Diagram was created from scratch since it was unacceptable in the first assignment.

The assignment due date is on the 18th of October 2020 before 12.00 am.
